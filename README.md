# UltraStack
**Name** \
Gabriel Caldwell

**Structure** \
My Computer Animation course required us to develop key animation library features, and implement those features in applications. Application specific code can be found in *assignments* and library code can be found in *libsrc/animation*.

Project dependencies are located in *3rdparty*. You shouldn't need to touch these.

For this assignment, the code I developed can be found in \
*assignments/a3-splines/ACurveEditor.cpp* \
and \
*libsrc/animation/AInterpolator-basecode.cpp*.

**Description** \
UltraStack is a casual mobile game where the player attempts to stack blocks as high as possible. I finished development and released the game on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in early 2019. The app has been archived and is no longer available, but you can download the PC version below. It was developed using Unity3D and C#. 

**Originally Created** \
