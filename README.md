The C# scripts I wrote for this Unity3D project can be found in *Assets/Scripts*. \
When looking at the project in Unity, you can find the main scene at *Assets/Scenes/TitleScareen* \
Prefabs for the block objects can be found in *Assets/Resesources/Prefabs*

**Description** \
UltraStack is a casual mobile game where the player attempts to stack blocks as high as possible. I finished development and released the game on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in early 2019. The app has been archived and is no longer available, but you can download the PC version below. It was developed using Unity3D and C#.
